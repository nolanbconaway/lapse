# Lapsepy

A small python library containing the tools that I've written over time to help make 
custom timelapse videos using photos taken from my raspberry pi.

This is a copy of some stuff from [rpi-camera](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/rpi-camera)
but with additions that I had been copying/editing in various jupyter notebooks.

I'm not writing docs and tests bc this is just for me :-). Also not on pypi bc I don't 
care.
